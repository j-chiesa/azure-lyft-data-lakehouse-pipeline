# Lyft Data Lakehouse Pipeline
This project entails building a robust data pipeline for processing hypothetical Lyft trip data. It retrieves a `.parquet` file containing trip data from the previous two months from the [TLC Trip Record Data](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) web page and loads it into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. The data is then processed using a medallion architecture within Azure Databricks (Spark), creating a Delta Lake for each layer (Bronze, Silver, and Gold). This structured data is subsequently leveraged to establish a Delta Lakehouse in a serverless SQL pool within Azure Synapse Analytics. Finally, Power BI connects to the Gold layer in Synapse, allowing for insightful visualizations that facilitate data-driven decision-making.

### Architecture 
This solution is based on the medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers), optimized for cloud storage and processing using Azure. Databricks is utilized for processing the data through these layers, leveraging Delta Lake to enable efficient data management and ensure data integrity. Below is an outline of the main components:
